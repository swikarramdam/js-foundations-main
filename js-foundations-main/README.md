# ðŸ“š TestFirst JavaScript Overview

TestFirst JavaScript is a multi-part series that provides practice to intermediate to advanced javascript concepts. The majority of concepts introduced in TestFirst have practice exercises. However, there will be new concepts introduced in TestFirst that you will need to learn on your own by reading documentation (it's important to begin learning how to read documentation efficiently!)

<details><summary><h3 style="display:inline">1. Create Calendar for study plan</h3></summary>

- This is a sample calendar for the JS-Foundation course. You can use this template to create a customized study schedule that fits your needs. The plan consists 5 days a week, with Saturday and Sunday off.

- Recommended Study Plan: Dedicate at least 8 hours per day to each topic: 2 hours for studying lecture notes and 6 hours for practicing exercises. By following this plan, you can complete all exercises in approximately 16 days (2 weeks).

- Alternative Study Plan-1 (4 Hours Per Day): If you can only commit to 4 hours a day, allocate 2 hour for studying the lecture notes and 2 hours for exercises. In this case, you will need around 32 days(approximately 1 month) to finish all exercises.

- Alternative Study Plan-2 (1 Day Per Week): If you prefer studying only one day per week, dedicate 8 hours on that day. With this schedule, you can complete the one part testcases in two weeks, finishing all exercises in around of 16 weeks(approximately 4 month) to complete the exercises.

- You can use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vMabsY-QTrwE7oFtdHixHACtz7vJL9n7qYlqVrXeyNM/copy" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a> to track your JS-Foundation progress. Save a copy of the spreadsheet to your account. Then, in the Timeline sheet, enter your start date and
  the number of hours you plan to study each week. As you finish each course, update the Actual End Date column in the Curriculum Data sheet, without changing the Planned Start Date or Planned End Date columns. The spreadsheet will automatically update and provide revised completion estimates
  based on the dates you enter.
